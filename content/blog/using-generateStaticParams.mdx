# Using generateStaticParams() to make static blog sites
In Next.js 13, the `generateStaticParams()` function allows you to pre-render pages at build time based on dynamic routes. This is particularly useful for creating static blog sites where each blog post is a separate page.
Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use `generateStaticParams()` for a static blog site:
## Step 1: Set Up Your Project
Make sure you have a Next.js 13 project set up with the necessary dependencies for MDX
and any other libraries you plan to use for styling or content management.
## Step 2: Create Your Blog Post Files
Organize your blog posts in a directory, for example, `content/blog`. Each blog post
should be an MDX file (e.g., `my-first-post.mdx`).

## Step 3: Create the Dynamic Route
In your `app` directory, create a folder for your blog posts with a dynamic segment,
like so:
```
/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
```
## Step 4: Implement `generateStaticParams()`
In the `[slug]/page.tsx` file, implement the `generateStaticParams()` function
to fetch all blog post slugs and return them as parameters for static generation. Here's an example:
```tsx
import { getAllBlogPosts } from '@/lib/api'; // Function to fetch all blog posts
import { GetStaticParams } from 'next';
export const generateStaticParams: GetStaticParams = async () => {
    const posts = await getAllBlogPosts();
    return posts.map((post) => ({
        slug: post.slug,
    }));
};
```
## Step 5: Fetch and Render the Blog Post
In the same `[slug]/page.tsx` file, fetch the blog post data based on the slug and render it:
```tsx
import { getBlogPostBySlug } from '@/lib/api'; // Function to fetch a blog post by slug
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote';
export default async function BlogPostPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {
    const post = await getBlogPostBySlug(params.slug);
    return (
        <article>
            <h1>{post.title}</h1>
            <MDXRemote {...post.content} />
        </article>
    );
}
```
## Step 6: Build and Deploy
Run the build command to generate the static pages:
```bash
npm run build
```
After building, deploy your Next.js application to your preferred hosting service.
## Conclusion
Using `generateStaticParams()` in Next.js 13 allows you to efficiently create static blog sites
with dynamic routes. This approach improves performance and SEO by pre-rendering pages at
build time. Make sure to customize the fetching functions and components according to your project's needs!
